# Linear_Regression_1
The goal is to predict an animal's body weight given it's brain weight. 

The model we'll be using is called Linear Regression. 

The dataset we're using to train our model is a list of brain weight and body weight measurements from a bunch of animals. 

We'll fit our line to the data using the scikit learn machine learning library, then plot our graph using matplotlib.  

##Dependencies  
pandas 
scikit-learn 
matplotlib 

You can just run pip install -r requirements.txt in terminal to install the necessary dependencies. Here is a link to pip if you don't already have it.  

##Usage  

Type python demo.py into terminal and you'll see the scatter plot and line of best fit appear.
